## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:

Problem: Predicting the release clause value of a player. 

This will help football clubs set the value of release clauses on their players.

Release clause is the money which another club would have to pay if they want a player from your club even before his contract has expired.


Predicting this might involve factors such as 

1. Player age

2. Player Overall- Overall rating of the player out of 100

3. **Value of the Player determined by their clubs in terms of money, how valuable that player is**

4. **What are his wages.**

5. **The time player has spent at the club** - The time in years the player has spent at that club

6. Player growth potential - This is something which I want in my data and woud have to be created using existing columns, this column shows the potential rating of the player , even if the overall(present rating) maybe be bad but in the future the player might develop into a really good player and hence would have high potential. Clubs want to keep such players, so you will have to pay alot to get such players.

7. The position the player plays at - In the real scenario one of the most highest paid football players right now are the players who play at the front(Attacking players), which is not fair because all positions are equally important but this is how it is. Clubs tend to pay more money to attacking players, so position matters.


**NOTE: The factors/features in bold would be created in future, there are issues with them which need resolving.**
