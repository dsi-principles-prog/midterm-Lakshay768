1. Player age

2. Player Overall

3. Value of the Player determined by their clubs in terms of money, how valuable that player is 

4. What are his wages.

5. The time player has spent at the club.

6. Growth potential

7. The position the player plays at : After feature engineering this would be 3 columns(Attack(attack_pos),Defensive(defense_pos),Goalkeeping(keeper_pos))


# Final Pipeline
```{r}
fifa20_data<-fifa20_data %>% 
   Growth_potential %>% 
  Attack_pos %>% 
  Defense_pos %>% 
  Goalkeeper_pos %>%
  Format_money(column=value,suffix="M") %>%
  Format_money(column=wage,suffix="K") %>% 
  years_playing() 
  
```

# Setting up features for the model
```{r}
filtered_data<- fifa20_data %>% 
  select(age,value,wage,attack_pos,defense_pos,keeper_pos,years_playing,overall,growth_potential)
```
